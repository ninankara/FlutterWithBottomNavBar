# My Template Collection

## Background
I often use the similar design pattern whenever I start building a new application. So I create and collect some useful base template in one place. 
The template was written while learning the related framework. Yeah, you may find a lot of template in different framework. 
You may re-use it.
Improvement and modification are welcome.
